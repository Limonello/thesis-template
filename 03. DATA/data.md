### Ref 2

KAFAI, Yasmin Bettina [et autres], Beyond Barbie and Mortal Kombat, New Perspectives on Gender and Gaming. Cambridge, Massachusetts: The MIT Press, 2008, 371 p.

- Video games are a cultural medium
- Pink games/purple games
- Video games as a tool to build/affirm a gender identity ( sometime over real taste)
- Context in which video games are played is important
- Focusing more on differences than similiarities
- Not just stop to the visual identity of a game, often offer something very different (overlap between genders)
- "Gender is a continuum rather than a set of binary" therefore, the ultimate game for one gender doesn't exist

## Method

- Theorical researches (book, articles, webstites, podcasts, ...)
- Interviews (people of any gender between 20 and 40 y.o) and make people test a game and react to it.
- Test video games on my own (to choose which game to test with ppl and see what's down nowadays)

### Interviews questions

Which video games marked you ? When ? And why ?

What appeals to you in video games ? Games examples ?

What repels you in video games ? Games examples ?

On which criterias do you choose video games (visuals, consoles, dev, content, marketing, ...)?

Is it easy for you to find games you like ?

What kind of relation do you have with your gender ? How would you define it ?

What kind of connection do you have with gender in video games (as a theme, related to your own gender, …) ?

What do you think about how video games deal with gender thematics ?

What is your opinion about video games "for girls" or "for women" ?

How would you define these types of games ?

Have you ever played to it ? What did you think of it ?

For you, what is a gender-neutral video game ? What could it be ?

### Game test with people

I didn't have time to do it yet but it will be very necessary to complete the interviews.

It would be between 30 minutes to 1 hour of gameplay for the participant and then a debrief about the experience.

### Game test on my own

I made a list of games I already played to and some I need to test.

Wondering if I should only focus on a certain type of video games.

## First results (interviews)

I interviewd 3 people in their 20's just to test the questions.

Diversification needed for the next interviews.

### Main obervations

- Each people uses to play to a lot of different video games
- Social seems to be an important factor
- The last question about gender-neutral games was very interesting
- Female/woman identifying and/or presenting people tend to avoid game with a sexist female characters. They are sensitive to female characters' treatment.
- One of the participants (woman) had bad experience with male gamers about being a woman playing video game or her tastes in video games.
- One of the participants (man), when he was younger, felt limitations playing to certain "girly" games.

I may need to reformulate or add some new questions (espacially for the "gender" theme in the interview).
